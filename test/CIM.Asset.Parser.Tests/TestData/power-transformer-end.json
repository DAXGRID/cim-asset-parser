    "Description":"An electrical device consisting of  two or more coupled windings, with or without a magnetic core, for introducing mutual coupling between electric circuits. Transformers can be used to control voltage and phase shift (active power flow).\nA power transformer may be composed of separate transformer tanks that need not be identical.\nA power transformer can be modelled with or without tanks and is intended for use in both balanced and unbalanced representations.   A power transformer typically has two terminals, but may have one (grounding), three or more terminals.\nThe inherited association ConductingEquipment.BaseVoltage should not be used.  The association from TransformerEnd to BaseVoltage should be used instead.",

For unbalanced transformers, this may not be simply determined from the constituent winding connections and phase angle displacements.\n\nThe vectorGroup string consists of the following components in the order listed: high voltage winding connection, mid voltage winding connection (for three winding transformers), phase displacement clock number from 0 to 11,  low voltage winding connection \nphase displacement clock number from 0 to 11.   The winding connections are D (delta), Y (wye), YN (wye with neutral), Z (zigzag), ZN (zigzag with neutral), A (auto transformer). Upper case means the high voltage, lower case mid or low. The high voltage winding always has clock position 0 and is not included in the vector group string.  Some examples: YNy0 (two winding wye to wye with no phase displacement), YNd11 (two winding wye to delta with 330 degrees phase displacement), YNyn0d5 (three winding transformer wye with neutral high voltage, wye with neutral mid voltage and no phase displacement, delta low voltage with 150 degrees displacement).\n\nPhase displacement is defined as the angular difference between the phasors representing the voltages between the neutral point (real or imaginary) and the corresponding terminals of two windings, a positive sequence voltage system being applied to the high-voltage terminals, following each other in alphabetical sequence if they are lettered, or in numerical sequence if they are numbered: the phasors are assumed to rotate in a counter-clockwise sense.",
