The most specific subtype of RegulatingControl shall be used in case such equipment participate in the control, e.g. TapChangerControl for tap changers.\nFor flow control, load sign convention is used, i.e. positive sign means flow out from a TopologicalNode (bus) into the conducting equipment.\nThe attribute minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue are required in the following cases:\n- For a power generating module operated in power factor control mode to specify maximum and minimum power factor values;\n- Whenever it is necessary to have an off center target voltage for the tap changer regulator. For instance, due to long cables to off shore wind farms and the need to have a simpler setup at the off shore transformer platform, the voltage is controlled from the land at the connection point for the off shore wind farm. Since there usually is a voltage rise along the cable, there is typical and overvoltage of up 3-4 kV compared to the on shore station. Thus in normal operation the tap changer on the on shore station is operated with a target set point, which is in the lower parts of the dead band.\nThe attributes minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue are not related to the attribute targetDeadband and thus they are not treated as an alternative of the targetDeadband. They are needed due to limitations in the local substation controller. The attribute targetDeadband is used to prevent the power flow from move the tap position in circles (hunting) that is to be used regardless of the attributes minAllowedTargetValue and maxAllowedTargetValue.",

As the cut is normally open there is no galvanic connection between the two line segment parts. But it is possible to close the cut to get galvanic connection.\nThe cut terminals are oriented towards the line segment terminals with the same sequence number. Hence the cut terminal with sequence number equal to 1 is oriented to the line segment's terminal with sequence number equal to 1.\nThe cut terminals also act as connection points for jumpers and other equipment, e.g. a mobile generator. To enable this, connectivity nodes are placed at the cut terminals. Once the connectivity nodes are in place any conducting equipment can be connected at them.\n",
