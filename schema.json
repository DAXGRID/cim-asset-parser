The term “lagging” in this case takes the place of the negative sign. If a signed PF value is to be passed by the data producer, then the direction of flow enumeration zero (none) should be used in order to avoid the possibility of creating an expression that employs a double negative. The data consumer should be able to tell from the sign of the data if the PF is leading or lagging. This principle is analogous to the concept that “Reverse” energy is an implied negative value, and to publish a negative reverse value would be ambiguous.\nNote 3: Lagging power factors typically indicate inductive loading."

For the example of s12N, phases 1 and 2 refer to hot wires that are 180 degrees out of phase, while N refers to the neutral wire. Through single-phase transformer connections, these secondary circuits may be served from one or two of the primary phases A, B, and C.

All generation and load within the area defined by the terminals on the border are considered in the area interchange control. Note that any number of overlapping control area specifications can be superimposed on the physical model. The following general principles apply to ControlArea:\n1.  The control area orientation for net interchange is positive for an import, negative for an export.\n2.  The control area net interchange is determined by summing flows in Terminals. The Terminals are identified by creating a set of TieFlow objects associated with a ControlArea object. Each TieFlow object identifies one Terminal.\n3.  In a single network model, a tie between two control areas must be modelled in both control area specifications, such that the two representations of the tie flow sum to zero.\n4.  The normal orientation of Terminal flow is positive for flow into the conducting equipment that owns the Terminal. (i.e. flow from a bus into a device is positive.) However, the orientation of each flow in the control area specification must align with the control area convention, i.e. import is positive. If the orientation of the Terminal flow referenced by a TieFlow is positive into the control area, then this is confirmed by setting TieFlow.positiveFlowIn flag TRUE. If not, the orientation must be reversed by setting the TieFlow.positiveFlowIn flag FALSE.",

The difference between the dc voltages of the rectifier and inverter determines the dc current. The extinction angle is used to limit the dc voltage at the inverter, if needed, and is not used in active power control. The firing angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filters are the primary means to control a current source dc line. Higher level controls are built on top, e.g. dc voltage, dc current and active power. From a steady state perspective it is sufficient to specify the wanted active power transfer (ACDCConverter.targetPpcc) and the control functions will set the dc voltage, dc current, firing angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filters to meet this. Therefore attributes targetAlpha and targetGamma are not applicable in this case.\nThe reactive power consumed by the converter is a function of the firing angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filter, which can be approximated with half of the active power. The losses is a function of the dc voltage and dc current.\nThe attributes minAlpha and maxAlpha define the range of firing angles for rectifier operation between which no discrete tap changer action takes place. The range is typically 10-18 degrees.\nThe attributes minGamma and maxGamma define the range of extinction angles for inverter operation between which no discrete tap changer action takes place.

Any piece of equipment may contain Measurements, e.g. a substation may have temperature measurements and door open indications, a transformer may have oil temperature and tank pressure measurements, a bay may contain a number of power flow measurements and a Breaker may contain a switch status measurement. \nThe PSR - Measurement association is intended to capture this use of Measurement and is included in the naming hierarchy based on EquipmentContainer. The naming hierarchy typically has Measurements as leaves, e.g. Substation-VoltageLevel-Bay-Switch-Measurement.\nSome Measurements represent quantities related to a particular sensor location in the network, e.g. a voltage transformer (VT) or potential transformer (PT) at a busbar or a current transformer (CT) at the bar between a breaker and an isolator. The sensing position is not captured in the PSR - Measurement association. Instead it is captured by the Measurement - Terminal association that is used to define the sensing location in the network topology. The location is defined by the connection of the Terminal to ConductingEquipment. \nIf both a Terminal and PSR are associated, and the PSR is of type ConductingEquipment, the associated Terminal should belong to that ConductingEquipment instance.\nWhen the sensor location is needed both Measurement-PSR and Measurement-Terminal are used. The Measurement-Terminal association is never used alone.",

This model represents older systems, in particular those DC commutator exciters with non-continuously acting regulators that were commonly used before the development of the continuously acting varieties.  These systems respond at basically two different rates, depending upon the magnitude of voltage error. For small errors, adjustment is made periodically with a signal to a motor-operated rheostat. Larger errors cause resistors to be quickly shorted or inserted and a strong forcing signal applied to the exciter. Continuous motion of the motor-operated rheostat occurs for these larger error signals, even though it is bypassed by contactor action.\nReference: IEEE 421.5-2005, 5.3. ",

This also makes the output independent of supply source variations until supply limitations are reached.  These systems utilize a variety of controlled-rectifier designs: full thyristor complements or hybrid bridges in either series or shunt configurations. The power source can consist of only a potential source, either fed from the machine terminals or from internal windings. Some designs can have compound power sources utilizing both machine potential and current. These power sources are represented as phasor combinations of machine terminal current and voltage and are accommodated by suitable parameters in model type ST3A which is represented by ExcIEEEST3A.\nReference: IEEE 421.5-2005, 7.3.

In this system, the AVR consists of a PI voltage regulator. A phase lead-lag filter in series allows the introduction of a derivative function, typically used with brushless excitation systems. In that case, the regulator is of the PID type. In addition, the terminal voltage channel includes a phase lead-lag filter.  The AVR includes the appropriate inputs on its reference for overexcitation limiter (OEL1), underexcitation limiter (UEL), stator current limiter (SCL), and current compensator (DROOP). All these limitations, when they work at voltage reference level, keep the PSS (VS signal from PSS) in operation. However, the UEL limitation can also be transferred to the high value (HV) gate acting on the output signal. In addition, the output signal passes through a low value (LV) gate for a ceiling overexcitation limiter (OEL2).\nReference: IEEE 421.5-2005, 7.7. ",

              "Description": "There are often stages of power which are associated with stages of cooling. For instance, a transformer may be rated 121kV on the primary, 15kV on the secondary and 4kV on the tertiary winding. These are voltage ratings and the power ratings are generally the same for all three windings and independent of the voltage ratings, there are instances where the tertiary may have a lower power rating.\nFor example, for three stages, the power rating may be 15/20/25 MVA and the cooling is OA/FA/FOA. The 15 MVA rating goes with the OA cooling (Oil and Air cooling). This is called the self cooled rating as there are no external cooling enhancements. The 20 MVA rating goes with the FA cooling (Forced Air cooling), this means that when the fans are running and thus enhancing the cooling characteristics, the transformer can operate at a power level of 20 MVA. The 25 MVA rating goes with the FOA cooling (Forced Oil and Air cooling), this means that when the fans and pumps are running and thus enhancing the cooling characteristics even more than before, the transformer can operate at a power level of 25 MVA. This 15/20/25 MVA does not state how the power is split between the various windings. It may be 25 MVA input on the primary, 25 MVA output on the secondary and 0 MVA output on the tertiary. It may also operate at 25 MVA input on the primary, 17 MVA output on the secondary and 8 MVA output on the tertiary.",

It allows a load that is treated as an ordinary constant power in power flow analysis to be represented by an induction motor in dynamic simulation. This model is intended for representation of aggregations of many motors dispersed through a load represented at a high voltage bus but where there is no information on the characteristics of individual motors.\nEither a \"one-cage\" or \"two-cage\" model of the induction machine can be modelled. Magnetic saturation is not modelled.\nThis model treats a fraction of the constant power part of a load as a motor. During initialisation, the initial power drawn by the motor is set equal to <i>Pfrac</i> times the constant <i>P</i> part of the static load.  The remainder of the load is left as a static load.\nThe reactive power demand of the motor is calculated during initialisation as a function of voltage at the load bus. This reactive power demand can be less than or greater than the constant <i>Q</i> component of the load.  If the motor's reactive demand is greater than the constant <i>Q</i> component of the load, the model inserts a shunt capacitor at the terminal of the motor to bring its reactive demand down to equal the constant <i>Q</i> reactive load.  \nIf an induction motor load model and a static load model are both present for a load, the motor <i>Pfrac</i> is assumed to be subtracted from the power flow constant <i>P</i> load before the static load model is applied.  The remainder of the load, if any, is then represented by the static load model.",

The firing angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filters are the primary means to control a current source dc line. Higher level controls are built on top, e.g. dc voltage, dc current and active power. From a steady state perspective it is sufficient to specify the wanted active power transfer (ACDCConverter.targetPpcc) and the control functions will set the dc voltage, dc current, firing angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filters to meet this.

The difference between the dc voltages of the rectifier and inverter determines the dc current. The extinction angle is used to limit the dc voltage at the inverter, if needed, and is not used in active power control. The firing angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filters are the primary means to control a current source dc line. Higher level controls are built on top, e.g. dc voltage, dc current and active power. From a steady state perspective it is sufficient to specify the wanted active power transfer (ACDCConverter.targetPpcc) and the control functions will set the dc voltage, dc current, firing angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filters to meet this. Therefore attributes targetAlpha and targetGamma are not applicable in this case.\nThe reactive power consumed by the converter is a function of the firing angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filter, which can be approximated with half of the active power. The losses is a function of the dc voltage and dc current.\nThe attributes minAlpha and maxAlpha define the range of firing angles for rectifier operation between which no discrete tap changer action takes place. The range is typically 10-18 degrees.\nThe attributes minGamma and maxGamma define the range of extinction angles for inverter operation between which no discrete tap changer action takes place.

          "Description": "The derived units defined for usage in the CIM. In some cases, the derived unit is equal to an SI unit. Whenever possible, the standard derived symbol is used instead of the formula for the derived unit. For example, the unit symbol Farad is defined as \"F\" instead of \"CPerV\". In cases where a standard symbol does not exist for a derived unit, the formula for the unit is used as the unit symbol. For example, density does not have a standard symbol and so it is represented as \"kgPerm3\". With the exception of the \"kg\", which is an SI unit, the unit symbols do not contain multipliers and therefore represent the base derived unit to which a multiplier can be applied as a whole. \nEvery unit symbol is treated as an unparseable text as if it were a single-letter symbol. The meaning of each unit symbol is defined by the accompanying descriptive text and not by the text contents of the unit symbol.\nTo allow the widest possible range of serializations without requiring special character handling, several substitutions are made which deviate from the format described in IEC 80000-1. The division symbol \"/\" is replaced by the letters \"Per\". Exponents are written in plain text after the unit as \"m3\" instead of being formatted as \"m\" with a superscript of 3  or introducing a symbol as in \"m^3\". The degree symbol \"°\" is replaced with the letters \"deg\". Any clarification of the meaning for a substitution is included in the description for the unit symbol.\nNon-SI units are included in list of unit symbols to allow sources of data to be correctly labelled with their non-SI units (for example, a GPS sensor that is reporting numbers that represent feet instead of meters). This allows software to use the unit symbol information correctly convert and scale the raw data of those sources into SI-based units. \nThe integer values are used for harmonization with IEC 61850.",

Regardless of the contents of the unit symbol text, the unit symbol shall be treated as if it were a single-character unit symbol. Unit symbols should not contain multipliers, and it should be left to the multiplier to define the multiple for an entire data type. \n\nFor example, if a unit symbol is \"m2Pers\" and the multiplier is \"k\", then the value is k(m**2/s), and the multiplier applies to the entire final value, not to any individual part of the value. This can be conceptualized by substituting a derived unit symbol for the unit type. If one imagines that the symbol \"Þ\" represents the derived unit \"m2Pers\", then applying the multiplier \"k\" can be conceptualized simply as \"kÞ\".\n\nFor example, the SI unit for mass is \"kg\" and not \"g\".  If the unit symbol is defined as \"kg\", then the multiplier is applied to \"kg\" as a whole and does not replace the \"k\" in front of the \"g\". In this case, the multiplier of \"m\" would be used with the unit symbol of \"kg\" to represent one gram.  As a text string, this violates the instructions in IEC 80000-1. However, because the unit symbol in CIM is treated as a derived unit instead of as an SI unit, it makes more sense to conceptualize the \"kg\" as if it were replaced by one of the proposed replacements for the SI mass symbol. If one imagines that the \"kg\" were replaced by a symbol \"Þ\", then it is easier to conceptualize the multiplier \"m\" as creating the proper unit \"mÞ\", and not the forbidden unit \"mkg\".",

These excitation systems include an alternator main exciter with non-controlled rectifiers. The exciter employs self-excitation, and the voltage regulator power is derived from the exciter output voltage.  Therefore, this system has an additional nonlinearity, simulated by the use of a multiplier whose inputs are the voltage regulator command signal, <i>Va</i>, and the exciter output voltage, <i>Efd</i>, times <i>K</i><i><sub>R</sub></i>.  This model is applicable to excitation systems employing static voltage regulators.\nReference: IEEE 421.5-2005, 6.3.",
